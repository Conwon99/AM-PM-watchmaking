              Estimates are always free (please enquire by email or by filling in the contact form). Before beginning any work a free fixed price quote will be issued, this price will not change. If proceeded, we will then issue a timescale for the repair and begin the work.

              If the customer decides to decline the quote then the watch will be safely returned.

              Warranties on Watch Repairs
            </h4>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-6 text-white md:text-base">
              If servicing your watch, we offer a 12 month warranty included with the service. Complete service and any parts installed in conjunction with that service are warranted for twelve months.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-6 text-white mt-3 md:text-base">
              Watches that have not been serviced are not warranted. This includes what is referred to as "partial repairs", such as works carried out on stem & crowns, straps, bezels, hand & dial repairs and glass replacements.

            </h4>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-6 text-white md:text-base">
              There is no warranty on partial repairs, however as a courtesy we usually offer to apply a previous partial repair's cost toward a comprehensive service if the watch requires a second related repair within one year.

              AMPM will honour our warranty provided that you retain the original receipt of work completed. Warranty is void if damaged by water, abuse (knocking/dropping the watch), or intervention by any third party.

              Water Resistance
            </h4>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-6 text-white md:text-base">
              If requested, and where appropriate, a water resistance test will be carried out in our industry standard "Greiner Leak Checker Prime". A report will be given on its ability to withstand the ingress of water. It must be understood that the test carried out in the workshop cannot replicate real-world conditions, as it is a static test within a dry chamber.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-6 text-white mt-3 md:text-base">
              The water resistance test does not constitute a guarantee of water resistance in any way, nor for any specified length of time. Gaskets can degrade quickly under exposure to chemicals or UV, and the test is solely for advising that the watch has been correctly re-sealed. Annual resealing is advised if the watch is intended for use in water.

              Damage resulting from mistreatment, improper use, or magnetism is not covered.
